Hello! This is a Chat App made with NodeJS. This project is part of [The Complete Node.js Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/) made by [Andrew Mead](https://www.udemy.com/user/andrewmead/).
The code was written while watching the course, creating a full Chat application.
